            <h2>An Excerpt from Jekyll & Mr Hyde</h2>
            <div>
                <p>Mr. Utterson had already quailed at the name of Hyde; but when the stick was laid before him, he could doubt no longer; broken and battered as it was, he recognized it for one that he had himself presented many years before to Henry Jekyll.

                Is this Mr. Hyde a person of small stature?‚Äù he inquired.

                Particularly small and particularly wicked-looking, is what the maid calls him,‚Äù said the officer.

                Mr. Utterson reflected; and then, raising his head, ‚ÄúIf you will come with me in my cab,‚Äù he said, ‚ÄúI think I can take you to his house.‚Äù</p>

                <p>It was by this time about nine in the morning, and the first fog of the season. A great chocolate-coloured pall lowered over heaven, but the wind was continually charging and routing these embattled vapours; so that as the cab crawled from street to street, Mr. Utterson beheld a marvelous number of degrees and hues of twilight; for here it would be dark like the back-end of evening; and there would be a glow of a rich, lurid brown, like the light of some strange conflagration; and here, for a moment, the fog would be quite broken up, and a haggard shaft of daylight would glance in between the swirling wreaths. The dismal quarter of Soho seen under these changing glimpses, with its muddy ways, and slatternly passengers, and its lamps, which had never been extinguished or had been kindled afresh to combat this mournful reinvasion of darkness, seemed, in the lawyer‚Äôs eyes, like a district of some city in a nightmare. The thoughts of his mind, besides, were of the gloomiest dye; and when he glanced at the companion of his drive, he was conscious of some touch of that terror of the law and the law‚Äôs officers, which may at times assail the most honest.</p>

                <p>As the cab drew up before the address indicated, the fog lifted a little and showed him a dingy street, a gin palace, a low French eating house, a shop for the retail of penny numbers and twopenny salads, many ragged children huddled in the doorways, and many women of many different nationalities passing out, key in hand, to have a morning glass; and the next moment the fog settled down again upon that part, as brown as umber, and cut him off from his blackguardly surroundings. This was the home of Henry Jekyll‚Äôs favourite; of a man who was heir to a quarter of a million sterling.</p>

                <p>An ivory-faced and silvery-haired old woman opened the door. She had an evil face, smoothed by hypocrisy: but her manners were excellent. Yes, she said, this was Mr. Hyde‚Äôs, but he was not at home; he had been in that night very late, but he had gone away again in less than an hour; there was nothing strange in that; his habits were very irregular, and he was often absent; for instance, it was nearly two months since she had seen him till yesterday.

                Very well, then, we wish to see his rooms,‚Äù said the lawyer; and when the woman began to declare it was impossible, ‚ÄúI had better tell you who this person is,‚Äù he added. ‚ÄúThis is Inspector Newcomen of Scotland Yard.‚Äù</p>
